## Explanation for the sampled.csv

Why the issues found by crossfix are all not relevant?

-- I think it may result from the codes implemented by gson. In [Issue1823](https://github.com/google/gson/issues/1823) there is one person to fix the code but was rejected by the author of the gson, since the code is breaking backwards compatibility. And there are all 3 open issues related to this([#1823](https://github.com/google/gson/issues/1823),[#968](https://github.com/google/gson/issues/968),[#1290](https://github.com/google/gson/issues/1290)).
